from angular2-echarts)\n\nOnline Demo\nOnline Docs\nStarter Project\n\nTable of contents\n\nGetting Started\nLatest Update\nInstallation\nUsage\nAPI\nEvents\nDemo\n\nGetting Started\nngx-echarts is an Angular (ver >= 2.x) directive for ECharts (ver >= 3.x).\nLatest version @npm:\n\nv4.0.0 for Angular >= 6\nv2.3.1 for Angular https://github.com/xieziyu/ngx-echarts/blob/v2.x/README.md)\n\nGithub branches:\n\nmaster for Angular >= 6\nv2.x for Angular \n\nA starter project on Github: https://github.com/xieziyu/ngx-echarts-starter\nLatest Update\n\n2018.08.20: v4.0.0\n\nChange: ECharts instance creating is delayed until view initialized.\nNew: [detectEventChanges] Use it to avoid unwanted change detections.\nIf you set it false, chartClick and some other event-emitters become silent. demo\n\n\nChange: [theme] now detect changes at runtime. \nWhen you change theme at runtime, the chart would be destroyed first and then initialized again. demo\n\n\nBREAKING CHANGES:\nES6 import instead of polluting global namespace. issue #123\nNgxEchartsService is now obsoleted. If you want to use echarts API, please just import itimport * as echarts from 'echarts';\n/** or */\nimport { graphic, registerMap } from 'echarts';\nNo need to configure angular.json any more. But we still need to configure tsconfig.json currently.\nImport echarts theme files or other extension files in main.ts. Refer to ECharts Extensions\n\n\n\n\n2018.07.24: v3.2.0 & v2.3.1:\n\nNew: [autoResize] now detects its container element's offset height.\nChange: Resizing detection is now debounced.\n\n\n2018.06.13: v3.1.0 & v2.2.0:\n\nNew: [autoResize] now detects its container element's offset width. Especially useful for charts inside  such as NG-ZORRO components.\n\n\n2018.06.12: v3.0.1 & v2.1.1:\n\nBugfix: Line chart is not animated on init. issue#102\n\n\n2018.05.08: v3.0.0:\n\nChange: Support Angular 6\nDocs: generate demo app by @angular/cli-6.0.0\n\n\n2018.03.14: v2.1.0\n\nNew: [loadingOpts] to customize loading style. Refer to API\nBugfix: double check dom.style.height before setting default value.\n\n\n2018.02.07: v2.0.2. New: [autoResize] input (default: true). PR #73 by arethore-actility\n\n2017.12.11: v2.0.1. Fix issue: No change detection involved in event handler. Refer to issue #26, #28\n\n2017.12.04: v2.0.0. Provide an echarts wrapper service: NgxEchartsService.\n\n2017.11.25: v2.0.0-beta.0. It has some BREAKING CHANGES you should know.\n\n\nInstallation\n\nSince v4.0\n# if you use npm\nnpm install echarts -S\nnpm install ngx-echarts -S\nnpm install @types/echarts -D\n\n# or if you use yarn\nyarn add echarts\nyarn add ngx-echarts\nyarn add @types/echarts -D\ntsconfig.json:\nYou need to map the echarts path to minified version of echarts in the compilerOptions of \"tsconfig.json\" in your project's root (this is important for AoT build):\n{\n  ...,\n  \"compilerOptions\": {\n    ...,\n+    \"paths\": {\n+      \"echarts\": [\"node_modules/echarts/dist/echarts.min.js\"]\n+    }\n  }\n}\n\nUpgrade from v3.x\n\nRemove ECharts related files from scripts in angular.json, including lib, theme and extension files.\nModify tsconfig.json according to the installation guidance above.\nImport necessary theme or extension files in main.ts. Refer to ECharts Extensions.\n\nUsage\nPlease refer to the demo page.\n\nFirstly, import NgxEchartsModule in your app module (or any other proper angular module):\n import { NgxEchartsModule } from 'ngx-echarts';\n\n @NgModule({\n   imports: [\n     ...,\n     NgxEchartsModule\n   ],\n   ...\n })\n export class AppModule { }\nThen: use echarts directive in a div which has pre-defined height. (From v2.0, it has default height: 400px)\n\nSimple example:\n\nhtml:\n\nscss:\n.demo-chart {\nheight: 400px;\n}\ncomponent:\n`typescript\nimport { EChartOption } from 'echarts';\n\n\n// ...\nchartOption: EChartOption = {\n  xAxis: {\ntype: 'category',\ndata: ['Mon', 'Tue', 'Wed', 'Thu', 'Fri', 'Sat', 'Sun']  },\n  yAxis: {\ntype: 'value'  },\n  series: [{\ndata: [820, 932, 901, 934, 1290, 1330, 1320],\ntype: 'line'  }]\n}\n`\n\n\n\n\nAPI\nDirective\necharts directive support following input porperties:\n\n\n\nInput\nType\nDefault\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n[options]\nobject\nnull\nIt's the same with the options in official demo site.\n\n\n[merge]\nobject\nnull\nYou can use it to update part of the options, especially helpful when you need to update the chart data. In fact, the value of merge will be used in echartsInstance.setOption() with notMerge = false. So you can refer to ECharts documentation for details\n\n\n[loading]\nboolean\nfalse\nUse it to toggle the echarts loading animation when your data is not ready.\n\n\n[autoResize]\nboolean\ntrue\nCharts will be automatically resized when container's width changed.\n\n\n[initOpts]\nobject\nnull\nThe value of [initOpts] will be used in echarts.init(). It may contain devicePixelRatio, renderer, width or height properties. Refer to ECharts documentation for details\n\n\n[theme]\nstring\nnull\nUse it to init echarts with theme. You need to import the theme file in main.ts.\n\n\n[loadingOpts]\nobject\nnull\nInput an object to customize loading style. Refer to ECharts documentation for details.\n\n\n[detectEventChanges]\nboolean\ntrue\nWhether to register mouse event handlers on echartInstance. Use it to avoid unwanted change detections.\n\n\n\nBy default, loadingOpts is:\n{\n  text: 'loading',\n  color: '#c23531',\n  textColor: '#000',\n  maskColor: 'rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.8)',\n  zlevel: 0\n}ECharts API\nIf you need echarts API such as echarts.graphic, please import it from echarts. For example:\n/** import all */\nimport * as echarts from 'echarts';\n\nnew echarts.graphic.LinearGradient(/** ... */);\n\n/** or you can */\nimport { graphic } from 'echarts';\n\nnew graphic.LinearGradient(/** ... */);ECharts Instance\nechartsInstance is exposed (since v1.1.6) in (chartInit) event. So you can directly call the APIs just like: resize(), showLoading(), etc. For example:\n\nhtml:\n\n\ncomponent:\n\nonChartInit(ec) {\n  this.echartsIntance = ec;\n}\n\nresizeChart() {\n  if (this.echartsIntance) {\n    this.echartsIntance.resize();\n  }\n}ECharts Extensions\nImport echarts theme files or other extension files in main.ts. For example:\n  import { enableProdMode } from '@angular/core';\n  import { platformBrowserDynamic } from '@angular/platform-browser-dynamic';\n\n  import { AppModule } from './app/app.module';\n  import { environment } from './environments/environment';\n\n  /** echarts extensions: */\n  import 'echarts/theme/macarons.js';\n  import 'echarts/dist/extension/bmap.min.js';\n\n  if (environment.production) {\n    enableProdMode();\n  }\n\n  platformBrowserDynamic().bootstrapModule(AppModule)\n    .catch(err => console.log(err));Service\nNgxEchartsService has been obsoleted since v4.0\nEvents\nAs echarts support the 'click', 'dblclick', 'mousedown', 'mouseup', 'mouseover', 'mouseout', 'globalout' mouse events, our ngx-echarts directive also support the same mouse events but with additional chart prefix.\n\nhtml:\n\nThe '$event' is same with the 'params' that Echarts dispatches\n\n\nIt supports following event outputs:\n\nchartClick: It emits the same params of 'click' event\nchartDblClick: It emits the same params of 'dblclick' event\nchartMouseDown: It emits the same params of 'mousedown' event\nchartMouseUp: It emits the same params of 'mouseup' event\nchartMouseOver: It emits the same params of 'mouseover' event\nchartMouseOut: It emits the same params of 'mouseout' event\nchartGlobalOut: It emits the same params of 'globalout' event\nchartContextMenu: It emits the same params of 'contextmenu' event (since v1.2.1)\nchartDataZoom: It emits the same params of 'dataZoom' event (thanks to averhaegen)\n\nYou can refer to the echarts tutorial: Events and Actions in ECharts for more details of the event params. You can also refer to the demo page for the detailed example.\nDemo\nYou can clone this repo to your working copy and then launch the demo page in your local machine:\nnpm install\nnpm run demo\n\n# or\nyarn install\nyarn demoThe demo page server is listening to: http://localhost:4202\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                   \n    \n         results matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"},"license.html":{"url":"license.html","title":"getting-started - license","body":"\n                   \n\nMIT License\nCopyright (c) 2017 Xie, Ziyu\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all\ncopies or substantial portions of the Software.\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
